# Ansible-lint is able to recognize and load skip rules stored inside
# `.ansible-lint-ignore` (or `.config/ansible-lint-ignore.txt`) files.
# To skip a rule just enter filename and tag, like "playbook.yml package-latest"
# on a new line.
# Optionally you can add comments after the tag, prefixed by "#". We discourage
# the use of skip_list below because that will hide violations from the output.
# When putting ignores inside the ignore file, they are marked as ignored, but
# still visible, making it easier to address later.

# Ansible-lint does not automatically load rules that have the 'opt-in' tag.
# You must enable opt-in rules by listing each rule 'id' below.

#- no-log-password # opt-in
